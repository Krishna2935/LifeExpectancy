The Life expectancy data was collected was from 2000 to 2016 and each of the 2938 entries represent aggregated data about 22 features for life expectancy from various countries collected by WHO(World Health Organisation).\n",

    "### Normalizing Numerical Features\n",
    "In addition to performing transformations on features that are highly skewed, it is often good practice to perform some type of scaling on numerical features. Applying a scaling to the data does not change the shape of each feature's distribution (such as `'Population'` , `'Measles'`, `'HIV/AIDS'` above); however, normalization ensures that each feature is treated equally when applying supervised learners. Note that once scaling is applied, observing the data in its raw form will no longer have the same original meaning, as exampled below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Run the code cell below to normalize each numerical feature. We will use [`sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler`](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.preprocessing.MinMaxScaler.html) for this."

    "- U.S.A has life expactancy of 77.93 as predicted. The main factors which involved in the number of years obtained are its 'Status' is 'Developed', a country which is termed as developed, known to have rich in resources and malnutrition . Population and Income compositionof resources are helps in increase of life expectancy. BMI also indicates that it's the  cause of obesity and leads to decrease in life expectancy . It looks like U.S have high BMI rate compared to other two countris. It has more number of deaths due to Hepatitis B and Polio.\n",
    "- Japan, the predicted life expectancy is 83.71 . This country's status is developed and has less number of deaths due to diseases like Hepatitis B, Measles an HIV/AIDs. It has less number of infant deaths. \n",
    "- India, on the other hand, has life expectancy 68.91 , due to having more number of infant deaths,deaths due to polio and  adult mortality rate is also high. GDP is low as compared to the developed countries like U.S and Japan. Population is also key factor here to consider as population increases resources will get decreased and expenditure spent also dectresed due to mass."
