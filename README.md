## Capstone Proposal


#### Using Supervised Learning to predict Life expectancy of people in a country

### Project: Capstone Project

This project requires Python 3.x and the following Python libraries installed:
NumPy Pandas matplotlib scikit-learn
Data: This data set contains total of 2938 rows and 22 columns. Target variable ‘life_exp’ contains life expectancy of each country for 16 years(from 2000-2015) .  Dataset has been extracted from Kaggle.
